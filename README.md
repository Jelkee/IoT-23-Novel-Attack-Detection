# IoT-23-Novel-Attack-Detection

This repository has collected the files used for thesis research done by Jelke Schr√∂der. A few important things to note are:

- The files in the directory 'filtered' do not contain all the data in the dataset. This is a sampled selection of data after data processing and feature selection. The dataset was too big to put in this repository. However, it can be redownloaded and reprocessed on https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23
- This code is a bit chaotic due to me working alone on the project. Therefore a lot of things have changed and e.g. you will not find the svm model code in here. I did not document changes thourougly.
